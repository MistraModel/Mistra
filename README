HOW TO RUN MISTRA -- in a nutshell:
-----------------------------------

1) Install KPP from https://github.com/Mistra-UEA/KPP-Mistra. Please refer to the README file in this KPP depository for instructions

2) Install a Fortran compiler (preferably ifort, alternatively gfortran) and the netcdf libraries

---

3) Check that C shell (csh) is installed on your system, then generate the mechanism files: in ./src/mech, run make

4) Check that netcdf libraries are installed on your system (locate netcdf.inc). If not, install the package libnetcdff-dev
Edit the Makefile (in ./src directory), set the correct path to the netcdf libraries and include file. Depending on netcdf distribution, use "-lnetcdf" or "-lnetcdf -lnetcdff".

5) Compile the code using "make".

6) In the param/param_... file, set the appropriate path to Mistra input files. It is advised to use a directory that will not be duplicated for each version the user will run, but choose a generic directory instead.
Set the appropriate path to parent output directory, to the executable, and set the namelist to be used.
Run the param_... file to run the model.

For more detailed information see the manual in the ./doc directory
