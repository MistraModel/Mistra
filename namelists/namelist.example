&mistra_cfg

 ! Restart mode and runtime
 rst = F          !<-- rst    : restart (TRUE) or new init (FALSE) of model run
 lstmax = 24      !<-- lstmax : runtime [hours]

 ! Output choice
 netcdf = T       !<-- netCDF : netCDF output
 binout = F       !<-- binout : binary output

 ! Timing and geography
 nday = 11        !<-- starting day
 nmonth = 05      !<-- starting month
 nyear = 2021     !<-- starting year

 alat = 0.        !<-- latitude [deg]

 ! Surface settings
 !isurf = 0        !<-- 0 is water or snow surface (default), 1 is bare soil
 tw = 299.5       !<-- water temperature [K]
 !ltwcst = T       !<-- constant `tw' (default=TRUE). If not constant, set `ntwopt' (see SR "surf0")
 !ntwopt = 1       !<-- choice for time varying SST (see SR "surf0")
 z0 = 0.001       !<-- roughness length [m] (default=0.01)

 ! Meteorological settings
 rp0 = 101325     !<-- sea level atmospheric pressure [Pa]
 rhsurf = 0.8     !<-- relative humidity at the surface, forced at each time step (default=1)

 ! Microphysics
 mic = T          !<-- mic     : microphysics included (TRUE)
 iaertyp = 3      !<-- iaertyp : aerosol type is 1=urban; 2=rural; 3=maritime

 ! Chemistry

 halo = T         !<-- halo  : halogen chemistry included (TRUE)
 iod = F          !<-- iod   : iodine chemistry included (TRUE) (automatically off, when `halo=F')
 nkc_l = 4        !<-- nkc_l : number of output classes for liquid chem (set to <nkc if no cloud expected)
 neula = 1        !<-- neula : eulerian (=0, includes advection of chem species) or lagrangian (=1, no advection)

 ! Box model mode
 box = F          !<-- box     : run model in box mode (TRUE)
 bl_box = F       !<-- BL_box  : box only, average init cond over BL and/or mean of J-values over BL
 nlevbox = 2      !<-- nlevbox : box only, level to be used for init cond of box if `BL_box=F'
 z_box = 700.     !<-- z_box   : height of box [m]

 ! Nucleation
 nuc = F          !<-- nuc : nucleation included (TRUE)

 ! Miscellaneous settings
 scaleo3_m = 300. !<-- scaleo3_m : O3 [Dobson units] (only for scaling in photolysis calculations)
