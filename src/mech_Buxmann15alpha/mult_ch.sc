# Modifications :
# -------------
  # 31-Oct-2017  Josue Bock  - replaced \? and \+ by \{0,1\} and \{1,\} respectively
  #                          The former are GNU extensions, and are not recognised by all systems
  #                          - corrected the first line #!/bin/csh instead of ##/bin/csh
  #                          - replaced rm, mv by \rm, \mv to use native functions without potential
  #                          user defined aliases (for instance, rm='rm -i')
  #                          - reorganised the tmp files so that they are all saved until the end
  #                          in order to facilitate debug, if needed.
  #
  # 14-May-2021  Josue Bock  add "exit from Rosenbrock" in the string list so that in case of error,
  #                          the user can know which mechanism was run
  #
  # 24-Jun-2021  Josue Bock  move the comment sign replacement (c, C => !) here instead of make_kpp.sc
  #                          and remove sed -i option ("in-place editing", to edit the input file directly)
  #                          since it was proven to be less portable (issues with MacOS)
